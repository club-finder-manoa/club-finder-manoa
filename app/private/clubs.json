This is a national collegiate honor society for students in their senior year. Each chapter is typically composed of only a handful of carefully selected applicants for the year - the Hui Po'okela Chapter usually does not exceed 25 members at a time. Potential members are chosen based on how they measure in accord with Mortar Board's key values: scholarship, leadership, and service. Those who excel in said values are then carefully examined through a series of interviews hosted by the chapter's current members. It is a great opportunity to give back to the community and form close friendships with fellow Mortar Board members. This honor society is more than just prestige, but rather, an opportunity for every undergraduate senior to make a local impact in their campus and community before they graduate. Once initiated in Mortar Board, every member will engage in various community service and fundraising activities. We not only help support each other and the Oʻahu community through various events but above all, we are making a global impact by building and growing the best leaders of tomorrow."
